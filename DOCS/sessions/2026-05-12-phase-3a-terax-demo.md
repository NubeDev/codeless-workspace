File: DOCS/sessions/2026-05-12-phase-3a-terax-demo.md
Goal: Get a working browser demo of the Terax-derived UI driving
      a real Codeless core. Open the JobsDashboard in a browser,
      see persisted repos/jobs, submit a job via SubmitJobDialog,
      watch the live JobTimeline tick through events from the real
      runtime, and exercise an approve/stop flow against a real
      review row. The CLI demo is implicit — `codeless serve` is
      the demo's backend.

## What's already done (not in scope for new code)
- `codeless-cli`: `run` / `job submit` / `review` / `tail` /
  `secrets` all green against a file-backed `--db`. The CLI is the
  reference embedder of `InProcessRpc`.
- `codeless-runtime`: `RpcServer` trait has the full method set
  (repos, jobs, reviews, subscribe). `EventBus::subscribe_since`
  replays from SQLite + chains to live broadcast tail without gaps.
- `codeless-types` + `codeless-rpc`: serde + specta wire types are
  authoritative; the UI's `wire.ts` snapshot already mirrors them.
- `codeless/ui/codeless-ui/`: Terax shell + `RpcClient` boundary
  + `HttpSseClient` + `MockRpcClient` + `RpcProvider` + the full
  `modules/jobs/` surface (`JobsDashboard`, `JobRow`, `JobDetail`,
  `JobTimeline`, `SubmitJobDialog`, `StatusBadge`) all exist.
  Browser shell `src/shells/browser/main.tsx` constructs the right
  client (with a `?mock=1` escape hatch).

The gap: `codeless-server` is a `fn main() {}` stub. Closing that
gap is what unlocks the demo.

## Stages
Format: `[ ] N. [S|M|L] title` — complexity tag mandatory.

- [ ] 1. [M] codeless-server axum app + REST adapter. Implements   ← next
         POST routes for every `RpcServer` method (add_repo,
         remove_repo, list_repos, submit_job, get_job, list_jobs,
         stop_job, list_reviews, approve_review, comment_review,
         stop_review) plus an SSE `GET /events/stream` adapting
         `subscribe`. Bearer-token middleware reads the token from
         the existing secrets file (key: `core_bearer_token`); a
         missing key short-circuits with a "run `codeless serve
         --init-token` first" hint. URL shapes must match what
         `HttpSseClient` already sends — verify against
         `ui/codeless-ui/src/lib/rpc/http-sse-client.ts`. Test
         coverage: tower `oneshot` exercising each route end-to-end
         against an in-memory `InProcessRpc`; one SSE smoke test
         that publishes an event mid-stream.

- [ ] 2. [S] `codeless serve` CLI verb. Opens `--db <path>` (or
         `CODELESS_DB`), reads the bearer token from the secrets
         file, binds to `--bind 127.0.0.1:7777` by default, and
         runs the axum server until SIGINT. Adds `--init-token`
         flag that generates a random token, writes it to the
         secrets file under `core_bearer_token`, and prints it
         to stdout once for the user to paste into the browser.
         Integration test: spawn the binary, hit a route, assert
         the bearer gate.

- [ ] 3. [S] Browser shell config + smoke. Confirm `readBaseUrl`
         / `readToken` (already in `lib/rpc/config.ts`) resolve
         from a path the demo can hit — likely `localStorage` for
         token + `?core=http://localhost:7777` query override.
         Write a 10-line `DEMO-UI.md` at the workspace root with
         the exact steps (terminal A: `codeless serve
         --init-token`; terminal B: `pnpm -C codeless/ui/codeless-
         ui dev`; paste token; open `JobsDashboard`).

- [ ] 4. [S] End-to-end demo dry run. Boot the server against a
         fresh DB, seed one repo + one job via CLI, load the
         browser at `http://localhost:5173/?core=...`, paste the
         token, screenshot or describe what the UI shows. Any
         field that renders wrong (status badge, timestamp) gets
         a follow-up Note in this file; do NOT widen scope into
         UI rework inside this stage.

- [ ] 5. [S] Phase 3a wrap-up. CODELESS.md gets a Phase 3a entry
         (codeless-server + serve + demo path). README quickstart
         gains a "Run the browser demo" subsection pointing at
         `DEMO-UI.md`. Three verify gates green; combined Phase
         2a+2b+2c+3a PR description drafted on the branch (not
         opened — that's a separate human action).

## Likely batching
- Tick 1: stage 1 (M).
- Tick 2: stage 2 (S) — maybe pair with stage 3 (S) if the
  diff stays tight.
- Tick 3: stage 3 (S) if not paired; else stage 4 (S).
- Tick 4: stage 4 (S).
- Tick 5: stage 5 (S) — DONE.

## Notes
- `HttpSseClient` already documents the wire shape (bearer header
  on REST; `?token=` query on SSE because EventSource has no
  header API). The server must conform to *that* contract, not
  invent a new one — the file is the spec.
- The UI is `?mock=1`-toggleable, so stages 1-2 can be tested
  without the UI by hitting routes with `curl` + `jq`. Stage 4 is
  the moment of truth.
- Single-tenant per R5: ONE bearer token, stored next to the
  secrets, used by browser + CLI + (future) mobile alike. Do not
  introduce per-job scopes.
- The user has in-flight UI work in the working tree
  (shell-injection adapters, settings refactors). Stage commits
  here must NOT sweep those in — use raw `git add` against the
  specific files for each stage, or do a `chore: stash UI WIP`
  commit before the first tick.
- `codeless-server`'s axum dep is new; add `axum`, `tower`,
  `tower-http` (for cors + trace), and the runtime dep on
  `tokio-stream` (already in workspace) for SSE.
